## 🎭 Who am I?

My name is **Raduan** and I'm the CEO of [Hakutaku.co](https://hakutaku.co) - because apparently someone had to take responsibility for this mess.

## 🐍 My technical journey (or how I learned to stop worrying and love the chaos)

I used to code in **Python** and **SQL** - yes, those languages everyone thinks they know until they need to write a proper JOIN. I spent years helping companies navigate their epic **data disasters**.

The idea behind Hakutaku is precisely to **stop this from happening again!**

*Spoiler alert: it still happens, but now we have a fancy name for the chaos.*

<div align="center">
  
```python
class Raduan:
    def __init__(self):
        self.skill_level = "half_decent"
        self.languages = ["Python", "SQL", "Sarcasm"]
        self.company = "Hakutaku.co"
        self.status = "CEO by lack of better options"
    
    def solve_data_chaos(self):
        return "We try, but data has a mind of its own 🤷‍♂️"
```

## 📊 My ego (prepare for disappointment)

hahahahahahaha how bad!

## 🔍 Feel free to stalk me =D

Unfortunately, I'm a **half-decent programmer**, but if you made it this far, at least my documentation works better than my code.
